title: How can I cancel my API subscription?
---
Cancellations for the API can be made by logging in to the [management environment](https://account.postcode.eu); this must be done by the account admin.

In the 'Management' menu, there is an item 'Subscription'. Here, the subscription can be cancelled as of the next possible date.
