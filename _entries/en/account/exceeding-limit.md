title: What happens if I exceed the limit of my current Tier?
---
First of all, don't worry, _**the API will not be turned off**_ if you exceed your limit. We find it important that the API always continues to work so that your customers can simply keep ordering and you don't get any interruptions in your processes.

To keep you informed of your usage, notifications are sent by email. This happens at 50%, 80%, and 100% of your limit.

At 100%, the subscription is automatically upgraded to an appropriate and fitting Tier. In doing so, the system looks at the usage in the past period of the current subscription period and makes a forecast for the expected number of requests for the rest of the subscription period.

To make a good estimation for the forecast, the Tier upgrade will not take place in the first month of your subscription period.

**Are you going over Tier 5?**

Then, based on the forecast, the expected usage will be invoiced in blocks of 10% of Tier 5 (i.e., per €100), and the unit prices per validation of this Tier also apply.

**Seasonal usage**

Because the forecast is based on your past usage, the proposed upgrade may not align with your total annual usage. For example, because you sell Christmas hampers or you are busier in the summer months because you sell swimming pools. Therefore, you can choose which Tier you are upgraded to, but this is only possible before the actual upgrade is carried out.

Should it turn out later in the year that it was still not sufficient, an additional upgrade will still be carried out.

**One-time limit exceedance**

If you want to set a lower limit for the next subscription year, you can. Check the [article for adjusting your Tier when renewing your subscription]({% link _entries/en/account/adjusting-tier-on-renewal.md %}).
