title: I lost my credentials, how can I request new ones?
---
If you log in with your admin account in the [management environment](https://account.postcode.eu), there is a 'Credentials' item in the 'Management' menu.

If you click that, you will see the Key. The Secret was only sent by email at the time and cannot be retrieved. On this same page, there is a button at the top right to create a new Key and Secret. These will then be automatically emailed.
