title: Can I enter into an SLA and/or a DORA addendum?
---
We offer the possibility to enter into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) and/or DORA Addendum for our services.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)**

The SLA records agreements on, among other things, the availability and performance of our services, including uptime, reaction times in case of incidents, and any compensations. 

**DORA Addendum**

The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) sets specific requirements for the digital resilience of IT services. To support our customers, we have developed a standard DORA Addendum that is fully aligned with our services. This has been drawn up in line with Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 (DORA – Digital Operational Resilience Act). The document is a supplement to our general terms and conditions and applies to all agreements where we provide services that regulated financial entities use to be resilient against ICT-related disruptions, threats, and incidents.

**How to request?**

We exclusively use our own DORA and SLA agreements. We therefore do not accept variants provided by customers. The reason for this is that our documents are fully tailored to our own services and processes, so that we can guarantee clear, achievable, and verifiable agreements.

The DORA and SLA agreements are available for a fee and are offered as additional add-ons on top of the existing subscription. Current prices are listed on our pricing page.

New customers can choose to add an SLA and/or DORA Addendum directly when registering an account. Existing customers can simply contact us to have this activated.
