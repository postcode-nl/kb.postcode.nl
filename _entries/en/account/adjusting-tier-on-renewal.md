title: How can I adjust the Tier for the next subscription period?
---
If you expect to make fewer requests next year, you may no longer need the subscription you have now and a lower Tier may be sufficient.

You can adjust the limit for next year to a limit that better fits your expected usage in the management environment. This can be done at the menu item 'Management - Subscription' when you are logged in with your management account. Under 'Next subscription period', you can set which Tier you want to renew with. 

If you exceed the newly set limit during the subscription period, the subscription will still be automatically upgraded to a matching Tier. It is, of course, also possible to set a higher Tier if you expect that.
