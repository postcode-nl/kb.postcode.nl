title: How can I reactivate my deactivated account?
---
There could be several reasons why your account has been deactivated.

## Account is disabled due to an unpaid invoice


Log in with the management account to your account. On the dashboard under subscriptions, you can click through to the invoices. Here you can view the status of the invoices and pay them directly. The account will be activated within a few minutes if you pay with one of the online payment methods. With a bank transfer, it can take up to several days before your account is active again.

## Subscription has not been renewed


If the subscription has been cancelled, the account will be automatically disabled when the subscription period has expired, and renewal via the management environment is not possible. For reactivation of your account, please contact us via email.

## Test account has expired


If you want to reactivate a deactivated test account, this is not possible via the management environment. For reactivation of your account, please contact us via email.
