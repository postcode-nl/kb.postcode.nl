title: Which plugins are available?
---
We have listed all plugins known to us on our [implementation page](https://www.postcode.eu/products/address-api/implementation). These include plugins for Shopware, Magento, and WooCommerce.

**Why do I have to pay extra for some plugins?**

The free plugins are provided 'as is', i.e., without support. Since there are many different plugins for the various platforms, it can be a challenge to make everything work together. The source code of some free plugins is therefore freely accessible so that implementation partners are helped as much as possible to build the site the way they want.

The paid versions are offered by third parties who provide support for their plugins. You then have an agreement with two different parties: with Postcode.nl for the API and with the third party for the plugin. These agreements are separate from each other.

**Is your plugin not listed?**

No worries, the API can also be integrated using the [technical documentation](https://developer.postcode.eu/documentation).
