title: Why does the International Address API show only a limited number of house number results?
---

This is a conscious choice because it is not practical to show too many house numbers. In some cases, a user would otherwise have to search through a list of dozens or even hundreds of results. For example, if it concerns a house number on the following street: [https://www.postcode.nl/1013GM/37-597](https://www.postcode.nl/1013GM/37-597)

Instead, with more input, the correct result can quickly emerge. After typing the house number, this number will immediately appear at the top.
