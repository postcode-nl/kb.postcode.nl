title: Why is Postcode.eu's API better than the competition?
---
At first glance, you might think there is only a price difference between Postcode.eu and other parties that seemingly offer the same data, but there are differences.

*   Most competitors deliver the BAG (Basisregistraties Adressen en Gebouwen) 1-to-1, which contains errors. These are addresses that do not comply with postcode logic, such as duplicate postcode-house number combinations or 4-digit postcodes in the wrong municipality. We perform a quality improvement pass over the BAG data where we correct or remove these errors. We also work with Dutch municipalities to remove errors from the data. As a result, the quality of the postcode data is of a much higher level and you only have the truly addressable addresses at your disposal.

*   Our database is updated daily instead of monthly for most competitors. Some competitors, such as the Google API, never update at all. They only add addresses but never remove them. This means you are not working with validated addresses.

*   Post office boxes are also included in our database.

*   In addition to the simple postcode-house number API, there is an auto-complete API that has the same functionality as the Postcode.eu search engine. This allows you to use the same advanced functionality in your own system as we offer on www.postcode.eu.

*   We provide address data for many countries via one easy-to-implement API.

*   Our API has very low response times: many requests take less than 0.01 seconds.

*   Unprecedentedly generous rate limits are standard with us: at least 150 requests/s and 35 requests/s, respectively for the Dutch and international API. Any possible peak in your usage is supported without problem.
