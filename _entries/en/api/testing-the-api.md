title: How can I test the API?
---
When you [register an account](https://account.postcode.eu) it always starts with test access, so you are not entering into a subscription yet. You have six months to test the API, and there is a maximum number of validations you can perform in test access. After testing, you indicate yourself when you are ready and want the subscription to start, choosing which plan you would like. 

## Do I need to change credentials?

All data remains the same, so you don't need to change anything regarding credentials when your site or system goes into production.

If you don't want to register an account but just want to see how it works, there is also a [demo on the site](https://www.postcode.eu/products/address-api).
