title: How do feedback reports work?
---
Our address data comes from the Basisregistraties Adressen en Gebouwen (BAG) of the Dutch government. Because of this, we cannot simply add, change, or delete a postcode. If something is incorrect, a feedback report (terugmelding) can be made.

With a feedback report, you can pass on errors to the relevant municipality.

In the case of new construction, it automatically appears on our site when the municipality has assigned a postcode in the BAG and the status changes to "Building in use". We do not issue postcodes, have no further influence on this, and cannot speed it up. Changes must therefore really go through the relevant municipality.

Once the report has been sent to the municipality, they will take it further from there. We process the changes we receive from the BAG daily.
