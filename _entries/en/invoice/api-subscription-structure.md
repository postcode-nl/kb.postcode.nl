title: How do the API subscriptions work at Postcode.eu?
---
Prior to the subscription year, you choose a Tier that you think you will need. No distinction is made in API functionality between the different Tiers. It is purely about the expected usage. 

**Why are API subscriptions charged prior to the subscription year?**

We do that to protect our customers from surprises afterwards (for example, extremely high invoices after a year due to runaway processes). Those always become "yes/no" discussions afterwards that benefit no one. That is why we work with a limit that is fixed and paid in advance. This makes it much easier to monitor how things are going. Usage notifications are sent at 50%, 80%, and 100% of the limit.

_**The API is not turned off**_ if you exceed your limit. At 100%, the subscription is automatically upgraded to an appropriate and fitting Tier. In doing so, the system looks at the usage in the past period of the current subscription period and makes a forecast for the expected number of requests for the rest of the subscription period.

To make a good estimation for the forecast, the Tier upgrade will not take place in the first month of your subscription period.

When renewing the new subscription year, the Tier of the upgrade is charged again because we assume that your usage will be the same or will increase.

**How can I prevent being upgraded to a Tier that is too large?**

Because the forecast is based on your past usage, the proposed upgrade may not align with your total annual usage. For example, because you sell Christmas hampers or you are busier in the summer months because you sell swimming pools. Therefore, you can choose which Tier you are upgraded to, but this is only possible before the actual upgrade is carried out.
