title: Which invoicing system does Postcode.eu use?
---
To send invoices, Postcode.eu uses an external party, so we can give all our attention to the APIs!

Moneybird is used. You receive the invoice sent from administratie@postcode.nl. If you click on the "View the invoice" link in the email, you are directed to a URL from Moneybird ([https://www.moneybird.nl/](https://www.moneybird.nl/)). Here you can, for example, pay the invoice directly or download it again in PDF or UBL format.

Via the payment page, payment can also be made directly using various payment methods.
