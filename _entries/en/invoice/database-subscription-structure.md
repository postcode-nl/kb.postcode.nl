title: How do the database subscriptions work at Postcode.eu?
---
A database subscription to, for example, the National Postcode Database Pro is invoiced prior to the subscription year. To keep everything clear, the chosen mutation interval as well as the chosen database format have no influence on the price. It therefore does not matter whether you choose annual or weekly updates.

After one year, the subscription is tacitly renewed.
