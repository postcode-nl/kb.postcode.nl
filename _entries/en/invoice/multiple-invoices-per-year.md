title: Why do I receive more than 1 invoice per year from Postcode.eu?
---
The address APIs and the associated costs are based on their usage. Subscriptions are invoiced prior to the subscription year. Thus, it can happen that the usage within the subscription year falls outside the chosen Tier. In that case, two things can happen. The subscription is upgraded and/or extra requests are invoiced.

**Subscription upgrade**

At the beginning of the subscription period, you can sometimes not properly estimate what the usage will be in the coming year. No problem. Our system reviews your usage in the current subscription year and makes an estimate for the usage for the rest of the subscription year. Based on that, your subscription is upgraded retroactively to a matching subscription. That is why you also see a credit for the old subscription on the invoice and the new subscription applies for the entire current subscription year.

In your account, you can indicate in advance what you want to perform as a maximum upgrade, as long as this fits with your usage. This can also be useful if you request the API seasonally; our subscription upgrader assumes that your usage is constant throughout the year.

**Extra requests**

Extra requests, indicated on the invoice as product code API1000B, are invoiced if the limit of the highest Tier is reached. Here, too, our system makes an estimate of the remaining usage for the subscription year and invoices this. Because you are already in the highest Tier, no subscription is credited.

**Invoices shortly after each other**

In a number of cases, usage is not estimated quite correctly, for example, if there is a peak in the number of validations at the end of the subscription year. Then it is possible, for example, that you receive another invoice shortly before the renewal of the subscription for the new subscription year.

**Multiple subscriptions**

If you purchase multiple products, such as the National Postcode Database and the API, it is possible that you also receive multiple invoices. These do not have to be invoiced in the same month.
