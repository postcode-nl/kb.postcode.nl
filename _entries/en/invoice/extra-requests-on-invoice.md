title: There are extra requests on the invoice, what are these?
---
Extra requests on an existing subscription, indicated on the invoice as product code API1000B, are invoiced when the limit of the highest Tier is reached.

Our system reviews your usage in the current subscription year and makes an estimate for the usage for the rest of the subscription year and invoices this. The extra requests are invoiced again when the subscription is renewed because we assume that you will also need them in the new subscription year.
