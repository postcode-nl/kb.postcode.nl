title: Why did I receive a Postcode.eu invoice?
---
We often get the question why we send an invoice; that is because we provide an address service to your company.

The invoice indicates which product we provide, and in all cases, this has to do with addresses. Doesn't it ring a bell? Then contact your IT department or web developer; they know where and in which systems our products are used.
