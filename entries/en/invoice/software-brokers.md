title: Can I use a Software broker to purchase any services?
---
Organisations may occasionally choose to work with **software brokers or procurement intermediaries** to manage the purchasing process of our services. While this may fit your internal procurement structure, please note that we **only support our own purchasing workflow**. The following guidelines apply:

### **Pricing transparency**

All pricing for our services is **publicly available** on our website. We do not issue custom quotes below **Tier 4 (€500 per year)**. For lower tiers, customers are encouraged to select and subscribe directly via our platform.

### **Software brokers are not resellers**

Software brokers are **not considered resellers** of our services. This means:

*   We do not provide **discounted pricing**, **referral fees**, or **commission-based incentives** to brokers.

*   The contractual relationship and billing responsibility remain directly with the end customer.

### **Purchase Orders (PO Numbers)**

We understand that some organisations require the use of **PO numbers** for internal procurement tracking. Please note:

*   PO numbers can be entered via the admin environment **before the start of the subscription or renewal**.

*   We do **not follow up** on missing PO numbers.


### **Subscriptions & renewals**

*   Subscriptions are **automatically renewed each year** unless cancelled.

*   All subscriptions are also **subject to automatic upgrades** based on actual usage.

*   For customers requiring PO numbers, we strongly recommend using **POs with an open amount** to accommodate future changes.


### **Terms and Conditions**

*   Our **Terms & Conditions (T&C)** are **final and binding** for all subscriptions.

*   We do **not accept any external supplier terms** or procurement conditions.


### **Product delivery**

*   **Our API is available immediately** upon registering and activating a subscription—**there is no delivery time**.

*   For subscriptions that include access to a downloadable database, the database file is provided **within one working day** in case of a new subscription. From then on, the chosen mutation interval is maintained.

*   Renewals do **not involve re-delivery** and there is **no service downtime**.


### **Best practices for organisations**

*   If using a software broker, ensure they are informed of the above conditions to avoid delays.

*   Direct your procurement team to our pricing page for up-to-date pricing information.

*   Make sure any necessary PO numbers are entered **prior to the renewal or onboarding** phase.
